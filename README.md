Analysis:
The data contained only one duplicate entry and one outlier, so this is a reliable source of data. It is clear that there is a relatively even spread of data as the mean and median tumor volumes for each regimen are close. Ramicane has the lowest mean and median tumor volume; however, Capomulin and Ramicane were the regimens that had the most mice tested. The sampling of male and female mice is a reasonable ratio. Of the four featured regimens, Infubinol has the highest range of final tumor volume in cubic millimeters with Ceftamin sharing the median but spanning more volume. We see how mouse b742 reduced his/her tumor volume from 45mm to below 40mm within 45 days. Also, there is a positive correlation between weight and tumor volume on average.  
----------------------------

The main trouble I had on this one was the for loop where my outlier data does not align with the whisker plot I calculated. I think I'm not clear on the request to merge it with the previous as I still had them separated into the chosen 4 drug regimens in the form of a list of series. 

It should be noted, if you have a dark background for the software you are using, you may not be able to see the labels and title due to the black font and lack of a background, so I converted the pie charts into png files within the folder labeled 'data'
