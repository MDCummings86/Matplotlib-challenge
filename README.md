# Matplotlib-challenge

The main trouble I had on this one was the for loop where my outlier data does not align with the whisker plot I calculated. I think I'm not clear on the request to merge it with the previous as I still had them separated into the chosen 4 drug regimens in the form of a list of series. 

It should be noted, if you have a dark background for the software you are using, you may not be able to see the labels and title due to the black font and lack of a background, so I converted the pie charts into png files within the folder labeled 'data'
